## Study Design

**We will discuss different types of bias, how they impact reproducibility and how to mitigate such effects.  We will also discuss how to determine an appropriate sample size**  

_Before we meet please take a look at the material below on bias in research_  

**Read a short article** about [Confirmation Bias](https://www.wilsonquarterly.com/quarterly/_/sciences-under-discussed-problem-with-confirmation-bias) or **a more in depth article** discussing [bias in microscopy](https://journals.biologists.com/jcs/article/137/1/jcs261567/341218/Believing-is-seeing-the-deceptive-influence-of) 

**Look up one or two types of bias** in the [Catalog of Bias](https://catalogofbias.org/biases) and think about how these could be influencing your experiments.  

**Try [this quick test](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/07/03/upshot/a-quick-puzzle-to-test-your-problem-solving.html)**  

**Take a look at this table from** [Stop Fooling Yourself! Diagnosing and treating Confirmation Bias](https://doi.org/10.1523/ENEURO.0415-24.2024).  It defines a several types of bias that can get in the way of good practice!

**Come prepared to discuss what factors cause bias in your own experiments!**  

_When we meet we will discuss the following (no preparation required but feel free to look at the material)_ 

Reproducible experiments start with rigorous and UNBIASED design:    
### Power and Sample Size  
* The sample size should be large enough to detect the predicted effect.  
* [Nature Points of Significance on Power & Sample Size](/Assets/PDF/Nature_PoS_PowerAnalysis.pdf)  

### Randomization and Blinding  
* Samples should be assigned to different treatments randomly such that confounding effects of biological or procedural variation are minimized.   
* Data should be collected and analysed in such a way that researcher bias does not influence the outcome (especially if data collection is subjective).
