#### Study Design

Reproducible experiments start with rigorous design:  
(1) The sample size should be large enough to detect the effect that is expected.  
(2) Samples should be assigned to different treatments randomly such that confounding effects of biological or procedural variation are minimized.  
(3) Data should be collected and analysed in such a way that researcher bias does not influence the outcome (blinding).  

**In this class we will discuss different types of bias, how they impact reproducibility and how to mitigate such effects.**
