# 1:P-hacking, HARKing and Publication Bias

## P-hacking

### Food tastes better if you pay more for it:
* [True Cautionary tale](https://youtu.be/Gx0fAjNHb1M?si=PfmYEN1ege_FOjBg&t=331) - watch the whole thing if you like but if you are limited for time then watch for about 70 seconds from where it starts.

### Green Jelly Beans Cause Acne:
* [Fictional Cautionary tale](https://xkcd.com/882/) - cartoon

### Correlation is not Causation:
* [Spurious Correlations](https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations)  This website describes correlations between completely unrelated observations and presents AI-generated possible explanations for them. The author even takes it as far as [using AI to create entire manuscripts](https://tylervigen.com/spurious-scholar)

### Some common p-hacks
_Pick one or two of the below and make an effort to learn what it is and why it is bad_
* [Dropping Conditions](https://youtu.be/u_jxEpQsOfI?si=PYgA7QzKI0WNnFpm&t=61)
* [Selective Stopping](https://youtu.be/qO57DH8gG9Q?si=tUKcr0Wb5Uue35T9&t=43) - aka data peeking  
* [Covariate Misuse](https://youtu.be/kGM2jT60SiE?si=powcGFryLCxv3L4W&t=95)- see also Correlation is not Causation above!
* [Multiple Measures](https://youtu.be/jiXmVjJTSmM?si=g9etZtGnMg5HbZSv&t=70)  

### Other questionable practices
* Representing standard error instead of standard deviation with error bars (SE makes errors look smaller)
* Not showing your individual data points (hides the data distribution)
* Removing outliers without clear justification
* Hypothesizing after results are known
