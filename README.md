_Before we meet on April 1, please take 20-30 min to watch some videos and learn a bit  about the questionable research practices (QRPs) that can lead to published research being non-reproducible._  

_During the meeting we will discuss these topics, why they are bad practice, how publication bias encourages these practices and how YOU can do better!_


## P-hacking, HARKing and Publication Bias

### P-hacking
"When engaging in p-hacking, researchers are assumed to explore different data analysis options in a trial and error fashion, fishing for ‘publishable’ statistically significant findings with little regard to the theoretical underpinnings of their research. This iterative testing procedure only ends once the researcher has obtained their desired result or has run out of creativity or patience" [Stefan & Schonbrodt 2023](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.220346)

#### Correlation is not Causation:
* [Spurious Correlations](https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations)  This website describes correlations between completely unrelated observations and presents AI-generated possible explanations for them. The author even takes it as far as [using AI to create entire manuscripts](https://tylervigen.com/spurious-scholar)

#### Some common p-hacks
_Pick one of the below examples and watch the video to learn what it is and why it is bad_
* [Dropping Conditions](https://youtu.be/u_jxEpQsOfI?si=PYgA7QzKI0WNnFpm&t=61)
* [Selective Stopping](https://youtu.be/qO57DH8gG9Q?si=tUKcr0Wb5Uue35T9&t=43) - aka data peeking  
* [Covariate Misuse](https://youtu.be/kGM2jT60SiE?si=powcGFryLCxv3L4W&t=95)- see also Correlation is not Causation above!
* [Multiple Measures](https://youtu.be/jiXmVjJTSmM?si=g9etZtGnMg5HbZSv&t=70)  

#### Other questionable practices
_Take a look at the HARKing part_
* Representing standard error of the mean instead of standard deviation with error bars (SEM makes errors look smaller and does not represent the variation in your data)
* Not showing your individual data points (hides the data distribution)
* Removing outliers without clear justification
* **Hypothesizing after results are known(HARKing) and concealing it!**
